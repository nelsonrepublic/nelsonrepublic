### Buying

<div faq="How can I buy an NFT?">

All buyers will be required to hold ALGO in a compatible wallet. Once done explore -

ALGO can be acquired through an exchange and then transferred to one of the following wallets: My Algo Wallet, Algorand Wallet and Algo Signer.

<div faq="What happens once I purchase an NFT?">

If the buyer purchases an NFT for a specified amount of ALGO, they will be prompted to opt into the NFT’s asset ID so they can receive it. Once the transaction is signed, the NFT will transfer to the wallet that is connected.

</div>

<div faq="I was the highest bidder in an auction but did not win. Why is this?">

All auction listers have the right to indicate a reserve price. This means that if the reserve price has not been met by the highest bidder, the auctioned NFT is not required to be sold to them.

</div>

<div faq="How can I learn more about the NFT I intend to buy?">

Whilst in an active listing, users can click on the arrow pointing to the image of the NFT. The following site contains useful information such as: the creator, embedded royalties and the quantity in circulation.

### Selling

<div faq="How can I sell an NFT?">

The seller must ensure that the NFT they wish to sell is in the wallet connected to YNFT and navigate to - [https://ynft.club/sell](https://ynft.club/sell).

The seller confirms which method of sale they prefer - auction or fixed price. Once confirmed, they select their NFT from the drop down list and fill out the corresponding sale details.

Finally, they may click Sell NFT and sign the associated transactions that YNFT prompts.

</div>

<div faq="What happens once I list an item for sale?">

The seller signs a contract that transfers their NFT to a secure YNFT wallet. There it will stay until an auction ends or it is purchased.

</div>

<div faq="Can I edit my auction details?">

No. Once the smart contracts and auction details have been finalized, the asset is sent to a YNFT wallet for the duration of the listing.

</div>

<div faq="What should I do if I no longer want my NFT to be sold or listed?">

All sellers should be certain of their conditions and preferences of sale before they list. Due to the nature of the blockchain structure, sellers are unable to update preferences until YNFT permits.

</div>

<div faq="The auction period has finished with no bidders, how may I retrieve my NFT?">

The seller receives their NFT back by clicking ‘close auction’ on the auction page.

</div>

### Minting

<div faq="How can I mint an NFT?">

Navigate to - [https://ynft.club/mint](https://ynft.club/mint). Before all else, users must ensure their creation is:

- less than 40 MB
- Of format: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, MP4, WEBM, MP3, WAV, GLB, and GLTF.

First, users provide a name - if ever listed, this will be its title. Then provide a unit name - if ever transferred this will identify the NFT.

The user updates the remaining information to their needs.

Once completed they can click ‘Mint’, this will mint the NFT and prompt a transaction that ensures that their newly minted NFT transfers to their wallet.

</div>

<div faq="Can I mint more than one NFT?">

Yes. Creators have the freedom to decide the quantity in the minting process.

</div>

<div faq="Which ARC Standard should l use?">

It depends on the project. For those unaware, the ARC3 uses official metadata format whilst ARC69 uses a format created by the Algorand community.

</div>

## Royalty and Fee breakdown

<div faq="Can creators control the royalties they receive?">

Yes. In the minting process artists can decide what percentage of the selling price they receive each time an NFT of theirs successfully sells.

</div>

<div faq="What fees should I consider when selling?">

To create a listing, users pay a negligible listing fee of 0.658 ALGO and Algorand’s additional 0.001 transaction cost.

If successfully sold, the seller receives the ALGO sale price, their listing fee back and pays a 2.5% fee to YNFT.
